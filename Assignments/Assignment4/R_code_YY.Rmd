       The title indicates the different outbreak settings including LTCH (long-term care home), retirement home, 
       hospital- acute care, hospital- chronic care and hospital- psychiatic and transitional center. 
       X-axis shows the primary causative agents including coronavirus, COVID-19, CPE unspecified (NDM), CPE unspecified(VIM),
       Enterovirus/Rhinovirus, Influenza A(H3), InfluenzaA (H3N2), InfluenzaA (not subtyped), Metapneumovirus, 
       Norovirus-like, Parainfluenza, Respiratory syncytial virus, Rhinovirus and unable to identify (from left to right).
       Y-axis shows the number of cases reported, with a range of 0 to slightly higher than 350.
       The bars are also color-coded by the outbreak types, where purple indicates enteric, green indicates other and yellow indicates respiratory.
       The trend shows that COVID-19 is the dominant causative agents in all settings, with highest number of cases reported in LTCH and 
       the least number in trainsitional center. In general, LTCH has the most cases of various outbreaks, while transitional centre has the least.
